# Systematic Program Design Notes and Homeworks
Here is my understanding of Systematic Program Design from [edx.org](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+SPD1x+2T2015/home) following the Core Programming Module of [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science?tab=readme-ov-file#intro-cs)

## 1a: Beginning Student Language
### Goals:
- Write expression that operate on primitive data types.
- Write constant and function definitions.
- Create a step-by-step evaluations of simple expressions including function calls.
- Use the stepper to autmaticall step through evaluation of expresions.
- Use Dr Racket help desk to discover new primitives.

BSL(Beggining Student Language) is a small and simple in the first module you will learn most of it. Simplicity means I can learn design methods rather than quirks of the language. BSL being forms the core almost all other languages means that the design methods can be adapted to other programming languages.
